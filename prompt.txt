I also have experience engaging with industry and other diverse stakeholders. I have interacted with pharmaceutical companies and supply chain management companies. I would like to design student projects that are currently relevant to problems faced by industry. 







\item An ability to develop a portfolio of external income generation

I have the ability to generate external income by applying for grants from government agencies and industry.

\item A track record of securing research funding grant

I have the ability to raise research funds through grant applications. I have submitted grant applications as a co-principal investigator to GCRF (Global Challenges Research Fund).

I have the ability to independently plan and manage research projects. I have experience making research budgets.



\item Strong industry and community engagement experience. Proven ability to communicate effectively with academic staff, researchers, students, government and health industry professionals

I have experience engaging with industry and other diverse stakeholders. I interact with pharmaceutical companies and other industry partners.


\item A flexible approach to work and the ability to engage with colleagues and scientists from different backgrounds and fields are required.

I believe collaboration is key to progressing science. I collaborate and interact extensively with my colleagues. I work with my colleagues in biostatistics and mathematics to develop new statistical techniques to analyse biological data. I also work extensively with my collaborators in the experimental sciences, especially immunologists, virologists and cell biologists to apply mathematical techniques to their problems.


\item Time management skills required.

I am very adept at managing my time.


\item  Well organized with good time management skills 

I am very well organized with good time management skills and can effectively prioritise multiple tasks.

\item Post holder may be required to attend courses or relevant international meetings to enable continuous professional development and remain up to date with current developments in the field.

I am able to and willing to attend courses and relevant meetings to develop myself professionally.


\item Flexible approach to work associated with requirements for research involving interdisciplinary techniques is essential, which will require ability to adapt the working schedule to varying hours at a short notice (e.g. late work).

I am able to work in a flexible and adaptive manner to ensure that deliverables and deadlines are met.




\item Evidence of ability to work collaboratively across disciplines.


I believe collaboration is key to progressing science. I collaborate and interact extensively with my colleagues. I work with my colleagues in biostatistics and mathematics to develop new statistical techniques to analyse biological data. I also work extensively with my collaborators in the experimental sciences, especially immunologists, virologists and cell biologists to apply mathematical techniques to their problems.


\item Willingness to continually update knowledge in the specialist area and engage in continuous professional development.

I am willing to continuously update my knowledge in specialist areas and engage in continuous professional development.


\item Strong programming skills, preferably in Python or Java.

I have strong programming skills in Python, R and MATLAB.
I am ranked within the top 200 worldwide on MATLAB Central (an online repository for Matlab code contributed by users all over the world). Prior to graduate school, I was a software engineer working in the financial services sector for Fortune 500 clients. Because of this experience, I write well-documented and rigorously tested code.
